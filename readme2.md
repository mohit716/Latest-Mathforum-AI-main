# Additional Setup Notes

A consolidated `requirements.txt` file is now available at the repository root. Install the project dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This captures the external libraries needed by the scripts in this repository, including the LangChain ecosystem, Hugging Face tooling, web front-ends, and supporting utilities.
