Math Problem: Find the area of a triangle with base 8 cm and height 6 cm.

Student Solution:
I need to find the area of a triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is:
Area = (1/2) × base × height

Given:
- Base = 8 cm
- Height = 6 cm

Calculation:
Area = (1/2) × 8 × 6
Area = (1/2) × 48
Area = 24 cm²

Mentor Feedback:
Great work! You correctly identified the formula for the area of a triangle and applied it properly. Your calculation is accurate: (1/2) × 8 × 6 = 24 cm². 

One suggestion for improvement: You could show the intermediate step more clearly by writing:
Area = (1/2) × 8 × 6
Area = 4 × 6
Area = 24 cm²

This would make your work even clearer to follow. Keep up the excellent problem-solving approach!
